# Pre-Admission-System (2020)
This is a mid size project that I developed during my 3rd year in college trying to learn web development. I was only tasked to work on the Admin section of the system, so I purposely uploaded only my part of the system. I don't wanna be sued or anything, so gotta play it safe.

## Technologies used:
1. PHP
2. MySQL
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Bootstrap
6. JavaScript
